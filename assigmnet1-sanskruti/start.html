<h1>Books are men's best friend</h1>
</div>
<div>
    <article> Books play a significant role in our life, especially for <em>children</em>. Reading books increases the knowledge of students,
      improves their intellect, makes students aware of the various societies, and civilizations across the globe. Moreover, reading 
      books enhances <mark>imagination and creativity</mark>  in the student's mind.</article>
        <p>When they say that books are our true best friends, it is true. Not only book our companions but they are also our haven. 
            Books never expect anything in return from us. Whenever we are tired or bored or stressed, picking up a book and reading helps
             us to go to another world – a world free of worries and everyday tension. At the same time, books enrich us and provide us with 
             unimaginable knowledge. 
            There are many times in life when we feel tired and defeated or 
            just feel like spending some quality time with ourselves – nothing better than sitting in a corner with a hot cup of tea and a nice book! The importance of books in our life is multi-fold. Printed or online, a book is a treasure chest of information and plays an important role in boosting our imagination.

              Masterpiece, incredibly funny. i don't usally go for self help books but this one was the exception. 
              There are a lot of points in the first half of the book that I agree with: prioritizing fewer things and the 
              right things; defining the right values
